    <h1>Astronaut Career Overview</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Astronauts are highly trained professionals who journey into outer space to conduct experiments, repair satellites, and gather data to advance human understanding of space and science. They work in collaboration with space agencies such as NASA, ESA, or private aerospace companies. Their role requires a high level of physical fitness, technical knowledge, and mental resilience, as space missions often take astronauts far from Earth for extended periods.
